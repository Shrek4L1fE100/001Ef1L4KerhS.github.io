    <h2>How 2 build a nuke (you will need this in the future)</h2>

<ul>1. pure fission weapons*(easy)* </ul>
<ul>2. boosted fission weapons*(normal)* </ul>
<ul>3. staged thermonuclear weapons*(hard)* </ul>
<h3>Lets make Pure fission weapons today</h3>
<b>Theory</b>
<p>During fission, the nuclei of certain heavy atoms split into smaller, lighter nuclei, releasing excess energy in the process. A neutron is shot at the nucleus and is absorbed, causing instability and fission. In certain isotopes of uranium and plutonium, the fission process also releases excess neutrons, which can trigger a chain reaction if they‚Äôre absorbed by nearby atoms. And it explodes.
Procedure
Plutonium can be used to make A-bomb. It's quite easy to just put the plutonium core inside hollow beryllium. And then when you just decorate it a little bit more, there. You have a nuke. You may be confused how to get these stuff, so im gonna give a list of how to make the chems.
To make plutonium</p>
  <h3><b>* RECEIVE NEPTUNIUM-237</i></h3> 
<p><i>A radioactive by-product of nuclear power plants. So ask them.</i></p>
<h3><b>* CREATE PLUTONIUM</b></h3>
<p>Bombarded it for a period of three to twelve months. As neutrons collide with the targets, some of them are absorbed by neptunium atoms. That creates a new neptunium isotope, neptunium-238, which decays into plutonium.</p>
<h3><b>* CONCENTRATE PLUTONIUM </b></h3>
<p><i>Filter the impurities through chemicals and stuffz.</i></p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<ol> Mr. Krab like money</ol>
<ol>You're gonna die.</ol>
<ol>Prank your friends!</ol>
